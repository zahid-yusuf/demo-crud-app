simple crud application

Here are the **functional requirements** for a standard **CRUD Java application**. These outline what the application must be able to do from the user's perspective, typically for managing a single entity such as a **User**, **Product**, or **Task**. This version is general but can be adapted to your specific use case.

### 6. **User Interface**

*(Applicable to GUI or Web apps)*

* **FR6.1**: The system shall provide buttons or menu items for each CRUD operation.

* **FR7.2**: The system shall use JDBC, JPA, or an ORM framework to interact with the database.

Would you like me to tailor these requirements to a specific domain (e.g., Inventory System, Task Manager, Library Management)? I can also generate **non-functional requirements** (e.g., performance, scalability) if you need them.
